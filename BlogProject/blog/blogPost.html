            <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <p><q>In computer science, <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> (AI), sometimes called <span id = "ML" style = "text-decoration: underline;">machine intelligence</span>, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading <em>AI textbooks</em> define the field
                as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe
                machines (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving". As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often
                removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. A quip in Tesler's Theorem says "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet." For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to
                be AI, having become a routine technology. Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go), autonomously
                operating cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, and military simulations. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed
                by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. For most of its history, AI research has been divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each
                other. These sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals (e.g. "robotics" or "machine learning"), the use of particular tools ("logic" or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences. Subfields
                have also been based on social factors (particular institutions or the work of particular researchers). The traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language
                processing, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence is among the field's long-term goals. Approaches include statistical methods, computational intelligence, and traditional symbolic AI. Many tools
                are used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics. The AI field draws upon computer science, information engineering, mathematics,
                psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields. The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it". This raises philosophical arguments
                about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence. These issues have been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity. Some people also consider AI to be a danger
                to humanity if it progresses unabated. Others believe that AI, unlike previous technological revolutions, will create a risk of mass unemployment. In the twenty-first century, AI techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent
                advances in computer power, large amounts of data, and theoretical understanding; and AI techniques have become an essential part of the technology industry, helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science, software engineering
                and operations research.</q></p>

                <p><q>Why give a robot an order to obey orders—why aren't the original orders enough? Why command a robot not to do harm—wouldn't it be easier never to command it to do harm in the first place? <br> Does the universe contain a mysterious force
                    pulling entities toward malevolence, so that a positronic brain must be programmed to withstand it? <br> Do intelligent beings inevitably develop an attitude problem? (…) <br> Now that computers really have become smarter and more
                    powerful, the anxiety has waned. <br> Today's ubiquitous, networked computers have an unprecedented ability to do mischief should they ever go to the bad. <br> But the only mayhem comes from unpredictable chaos or from human malice
                    in the form of viruses. <br> We no longer worry about electronic serial killers or subversive silicon cabals because we are beginning to appreciate that malevolence—like vision, motor coordination, and common sense—does not come free
                    with computation but has to be programmed in. <br> (…) Aggression, like every other part of human behavior we take for granted, is a challenging engineering problem!</q></p>

            Hi, my name is Nithin Pillai and I attend Mission Creek High School. This is the first out of the seven projects that the Udacity NanoDegree Course offers and I had a lot of fun testing my abilities as well as my understanding of how HTML and CSS can
            work individually as well as cohesively together. Now that I know that HTML and CSS can bring me this far in programming my website from scratch, I am very eager to see what <span id="javaScriptText" style="text-decoration: underline;">Java Script</span>            has to offer to make my websites more user-friendly and interactive!
